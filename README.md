# bibtext-usvc
An experimental REST microservice for accessing biblical text data

## Background
This is a first attempt to design a REST API from scratch spec-first that
can support a true HATEOAS behaviour. A good deal of assistance comes from
Mike Stowe's 'Undisturbed REST'. The API is specified first in [JSONAPI]
(http://jsonapi.com).
